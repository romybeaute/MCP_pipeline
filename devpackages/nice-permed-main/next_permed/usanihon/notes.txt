I did the io, but I need to figure out the preprocessing. 
Should I use autoreject just like in the low channel density examples Fede sent me. 


Or should I use the same preprocessing as the high density, 
but in this case there is no specific filter for the nihon data...


Answer: The first option


...
When I read the file from my laptop and from the computer
the channel names differ???

And the channels are not the same... How???
The .LOG file is not being read on Linux...


Fixed, the same name needs to be for all files plus the .pnt needs to be in capslock .PNT in Linux ?? why
